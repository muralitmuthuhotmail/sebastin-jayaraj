# Build the Docker image
docker build -t findoora-docs .

# Run the container
docker run -d \
  --name findoora-docs \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  findoora-docs

# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### Docker Commands Reference

pnpm dev:debug        # Start with debugging enabled

# Building
pnpm build            # Production build
pnpm start            # Start production server
pnpm preview          # Preview production build locally

# Code Quality

npm i -g vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Set environment variables (if needed)
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL
```

### Netlify

```bash
# Build command
pnpm build

# Publish directory
.next

# Environment variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-site.netlify.app
```

### Railway

```bash
# Connect your GitHub repository
# Set build command: pnpm build
# Set start command: pnpm start
# Add environment variables as needed
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Base URL for the application
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# API Base URL (usually same as base URL)
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Optional: Google Analytics
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX

# Optional: Google Site Verification
GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION=your-verification-code

# Optional: Disable telemetry
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
```

### Production Environment Variables

For production deployments, set these environment variables:

```env
# Production settings
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_API_URL=https://your-domain.com

# Analytics (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=your-google-analytics-id

# Performance (optional)
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
```

## Health Check

After installation, verify everything is working:

```bash
# Check if the application is running
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Expected response:
# {"status": "ok", "timestamp": "2025-07-26T..."}
```

## Updating

### Docker Update

```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Rebuild and restart
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Local Development Update

```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Update dependencies
pnpm install

# Restart development server
pnpm dev
```

## Troubleshooting Installation

### Common Issues

**Port already in use:**

```bash
# Find what's using port 3000
lsof -i :3000

# Kill the process (replace PID)
kill -9 <PID>

# Or use a different port
PORT=3001 pnpm dev
```

**Docker build fails:**

```bash
# Clean Docker cache
docker system prune -a

# Rebuild without cache
docker build --no-cache -t findoora-docs .
```

**Permission errors (Linux/macOS):**

```bash
# Fix file permissions
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER .

# Or run with correct permissions
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

**Node.js version issues:**

```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version

# Install/update Node.js using nvm
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

**pnpm not found:**

```bash
# Install pnpm globally
npm install -g pnpm

# Or use npm instead
npm install
npm run dev
```
