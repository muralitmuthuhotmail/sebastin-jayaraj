## Basic Task List

Here's a simple task list to test the functionality:

- [x] Install remark-gfm plugin
- [x] Configure MDX with table support
- [x] Update content types
- [ ] Add table sorting functionality
- [ ] Implement table filtering

## Mixed Lists

Regular unordered list:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

Another task list:

- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Pending task
- [x] Another completed task

## Nested Lists

- [x] Main task completed
  - [x] Subtask 1 done
  - [ ] Subtask 2 pending
- [ ] Main task 2 pending
  - [ ] Subtask A
  - [ ] Subtask B

## Regular Content

This is just regular paragraph content to make sure other MDX features still work properly.

```javascript
console.log("Code blocks should still work");
```

> Blockquotes should also work fine

[Links should work too](#)
